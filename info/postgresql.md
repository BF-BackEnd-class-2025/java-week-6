# üêò PostgreSQL ‚Äì Essential Commands

PostgreSQL is one of the most powerful and widely used **relational database systems**.
This guide covers the most important commands every Java backend developer must know to interact with databases confidently.

---

## üìò 1. Database Management Commands

### üß± Create a Database

```sql
CREATE DATABASE school_db;
```

‚úÖ Creates a new database named `school_db`.

---

### üîç List Databases

```sql
\l
```

‚úÖ Lists all databases in PostgreSQL (used in `psql` shell).

---

### üöÄ Connect to a Database

```sql
\c school_db
```

‚úÖ Switches your current session to `school_db`.

---

### ‚ùå Delete a Database

```sql
DROP DATABASE school_db;
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Irreversible ‚Äî deletes the entire database and its data.

---

## üß© 2. Table Management Commands

### üèóÔ∏è Create a Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    age INT,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
);
```

‚úÖ Creates a table with an auto-incrementing `id`, unique email, and non-null `name`.

---

### üìã Show All Tables

```sql
\dt
```

‚úÖ Lists all tables in the current database.

---

### üîç View Table Structure

```sql
\d students
```

‚úÖ Displays the columns, data types, and constraints of the `students` table.

---

### üß± Alter a Table (Add a Column)

```sql
ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN phone VARCHAR(20);
```

‚úÖ Adds a new column named `phone`.

---

### ‚ùå Drop a Table

```sql
DROP TABLE students;
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Removes the table and all its data permanently.

---

## üßæ 3. Inserting Data

### üìù Basic INSERT

```sql
INSERT INTO students (name, age, email)
VALUES ('Alice', 22, 'alice@example.com');
```

‚úÖ Inserts a new student record.

---

### üß∞ Insert Multiple Rows

```sql
INSERT INTO students (name, age, email)
VALUES 
('Bob', 20, 'bob@example.com'),
('Clara', 23, 'clara@example.com');
```

‚úÖ Efficient way to add multiple records at once.

---

## üîç 4. Reading Data (SELECT)

### üß† Select All Rows

```sql
SELECT * FROM students;
```

‚úÖ Retrieves all rows and columns from the table.

---

### üéØ Select Specific Columns

```sql
SELECT name, age FROM students;
```

‚úÖ Returns only selected fields.

---

### üìå Filtering with WHERE

```sql
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age > 21;
```

‚úÖ Retrieves only rows that match the condition.

---

### üî§ Pattern Matching (LIKE)

```sql
SELECT * FROM students WHERE name LIKE 'A%';
```

‚úÖ Finds names starting with ‚ÄúA‚Äù.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Sorting Results

```sql
SELECT * FROM students ORDER BY age DESC;
```

‚úÖ Sorts results by age (descending order).

---

### üî¢ Limiting Results

```sql
SELECT * FROM students LIMIT 5;
```

‚úÖ Shows only the first 5 rows.

---

## üßÆ 5. Updating Data

### ‚úèÔ∏è Update One Record

```sql
UPDATE students
SET email = 'alice@newmail.com'
WHERE id = 1;
```

‚úÖ Updates Alice‚Äôs email only.

---

### ‚úèÔ∏è Update Multiple Records

```sql
UPDATE students
SET age = age + 1;
```

‚úÖ Increments all students‚Äô ages by 1.

---

‚ö†Ô∏è Always use `WHERE` to avoid unintentional mass updates.

---

## üóëÔ∏è 6. Deleting Data

### ‚ùå Delete Specific Record

```sql
DELETE FROM students WHERE id = 3;
```

‚úÖ Deletes one record by ID.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Delete All Records

```sql
DELETE FROM students;
```

‚úÖ Removes all data (table remains).

---

### üí£ Drop Table Data Safely

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE students RESTART IDENTITY;
```

‚úÖ Deletes all rows and resets auto-increment IDs.

---

## üîó 7. Keys and Relationships

### üß© Primary Key

Ensures each record is **unique** and **identifiable**.

```sql
CREATE TABLE departments (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50)
);
```

---

### üîë Foreign Key

Links two tables together (enforces relationships).

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    department_id INT REFERENCES departments(id)
);
```

‚úÖ Ensures every `department_id` in `employees` exists in `departments`.

---

### üîó One-to-Many Example

* One department ‚Üí many employees
* One employee ‚Üí belongs to one department

---

## üìä 8. Aggregate Functions

### üßÆ COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM students;        -- total students
SELECT AVG(age) FROM students;        -- average age
SELECT MAX(age) FROM students;        -- oldest student
```

‚úÖ Use aggregate functions for summary data.

---

### üß© GROUP BY Example

```sql
SELECT age, COUNT(*) AS total
FROM students
GROUP BY age;
```

‚úÖ Groups students by age and counts how many have that age.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 9. Joins (Combining Tables)

### üß± INNER JOIN

```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.name AS department
FROM employees
JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```

‚úÖ Combines data from two tables where there‚Äôs a match.

---

### üß© LEFT JOIN

```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.name
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```

‚úÖ Returns all employees, even those without a department.

---

## üîê 10. Constraints

| `DEFAULT`     | Assign default value     | `created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()` |

---

## üß∞ 11. Data Export & Import

### üì§ Export Data to CSV

```sql
COPY students TO '/tmp/students.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;
```

---

### üì• Import Data from CSV

```sql
COPY students(name, age, email)
FROM '/tmp/students.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;
```

‚úÖ Great for bulk data transfers.

---

## üß† 12. User & Permission Management

### üë§ Create a User

```sql
CREATE USER sam WITH PASSWORD 'securepass';
```

---
